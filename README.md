# Project Zoomaway
Meaningful gamefication is the use of gameful and playful layers to help a user find personal connections that motivate engagement with a specific context for long term change. Due to this concept, there have been developments in trying to make educational classes fun and interactive for students, in order to keep them motivated and interested in learning. 

Thus, the purpose of this project is to provide teachers with an intuitive method that they can use in order to make programming lessons enriching and engaging for their students by utilizing a web interface that can communicate with a robot car. We hope to create a user-friendly and interactive web interface to make learning more meaningful for the students.

“How to run” section
keep it straight to the point of how to access the entry point of the web app
any necessary dependencies to run it

“Development Workflow” section
provide a brief yet sufficiently comprehensive description of your team’s workflow using git and GitHub features

“UAT” section
include an updated use case diagram and system state diagram if there are changes made based on M2. Highlight the changes clearly.
![System State Diagram - Page 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71886838/144844521-a1301152-0b3b-4f6e-a51a-604b31ebfd55.png)

an embedded video that runs through all the system test cases you have created (and refined) from M2
~3 mins long to cover all system tests

“Whitebox Testing” section
choose one meaningful class to demonstrate your test code. “Meaningful” here means 2 or more interactions with other classes, e.g., a Control class. Please do not use an Entity class.
list the test cases for this test suite (for this one class) and where they reside in your repo
show code coverage statistics for each test case, including an explanation of how you have generated these statistics (whether manual, through a lib, or via the IDE)
provide instructions how to run the test suite
embed an animated gif or another short video (~1 min) of the test case being ran
