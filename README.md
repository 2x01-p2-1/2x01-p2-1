# Project Zoomaway
# Introduction
Meaningful gamefication is the use of gameful and playful layers to help a user find personal connections that motivate engagement with a specific context for long term change. Due to this concept, there have been developments in trying to make educational classes fun and interactive for students, in order to keep them motivated and interested in learning. 

Thus, the purpose of this project is to provide teachers with an intuitive method that they can use in order to make programming lessons enriching and engaging for their students by utilizing a web interface that can communicate with a robot car. We hope to create a user-friendly and interactive web interface to make learning more meaningful for the students.

# “How to run” section
keep it straight to the point of how to access the entry point of the web app
any necessary dependencies to run it

Step 1: Clone from Github main branch using "git clone https://github.com/2x01-p2-1/2x01-p2-1" to the directory of your choice

Step 2: Open Command Prompt

Step 3: Type "cd (cloned main branch directory)" in the Command Prompt

Step 3: Type "cd zoomaway" in the Command Prompt

Step 4: Type "npm install" in the Command Prompt

Step 5: Type "npm start" in the Command Prompt

Step 6: Type "localhost:3000" in a web browser to access the website

# “Development Workflow” section
provide a brief yet sufficiently comprehensive description of your team’s workflow using git and GitHub features

For branch management, our team have decided to create the branches based on the various features that the website had to offer. Each member would be allocated features that they would be in-charge of. After making changes to their features, they would commit the code to their allocated branch. The process would be repeated by each member until they have completed developing on the features. 

Upon the completion of the development of the features, all the branches would be merged to dev for intergation of the features..............then to main??????

# “UAT” section
include an updated use case diagram and system state diagram if there are changes made based on M2. Highlight the changes clearly.

an embedded video that runs through all the system test cases you have created (and refined) from M2
~3 mins long to cover all system tests

# “Whitebox Testing” section
choose one meaningful class to demonstrate your test code. “Meaningful” here means 2 or more interactions with other classes, e.g., a Control class. Please do not use an Entity class.
list the test cases for this test suite (for this one class) and where they reside in your repo
show code coverage statistics for each test case, including an explanation of how you have generated these statistics (whether manual, through a lib, or via the IDE)
provide instructions how to run the test suite
embed an animated gif or another short video (~1 min) of the test case being ran
