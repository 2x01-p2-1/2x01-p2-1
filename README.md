# Project Zoomaway
Meaningful gamefication is the use of gameful and playful layers to help a user find personal connections that motivate engagement with a specific context for long term change. Due to this concept, there have been developments in trying to make educational classes fun and interactive for students, in order to keep them motivated and interested in learning. 

Thus, the purpose of this project is to provide teachers with an intuitive method that they can use in order to make programming lessons enriching and engaging for their students by utilizing a web interface that can communicate with a robot car. We hope to create a user-friendly and interactive web interface to make learning more meaningful for the students.
